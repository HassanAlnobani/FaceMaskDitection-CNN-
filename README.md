# FaceMaskDitection-CNN-
Loads image data from a specified directory using TensorFlow's image_dataset_from_directory.
Defines a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow's Sequential API.
Compiles the model with the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical crossentropy loss.
Trains the model on the training dataset and validates it on the testing dataset.
Plots and displays the training loss and accuracy over epochs.
Saves the trained model as 'maskDetector.model'.
